# Welcome to RemCCG Homepage!

**RemCCG** is a remanufactured C program generator achieved by the framework *RemGen* proposed in the paper "RemGen: Remanufacturing A Program Generators for Compiler Testing" (Under Review).

----
## Notes
* Please kindly note this is the initial version of **RemCCG**, and it is not runnable for now mainly due to some path dependences (e.g., some required libraries) issues.
* The detailed setup tutorial will be updated before the final release of the tool.

## Thanks and Have a Nice Day !
